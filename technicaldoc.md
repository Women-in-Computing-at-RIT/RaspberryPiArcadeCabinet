[RetroPie]: https://retropie.org.uk/docs/

## Setup
The raspberry pi has [RetroPie] installed on it. When the Pi is plugged in it should start up into RetroPie, and display a welcome screen. From there you can plug in your controller, and configure it. Each player on the button board is an individual controller, and player 2 does not have a Start, Select, or HotKey button.
## Hardware
### Buttons
Each button can have the cap removed to change the letter inside of it. The buttons are wired with a 3 pin female adapter.
### Joysticks
The Joystick on it's own has no cable, but a 5 pin male port. A cable for this is required, and we would recommend having a spare or 2.
### Board
Each player has a board that the buttons and the joystick plug into. This board connects to the Pi through a USB a - USB b (2.0) cable.
